# Python Dictionaries
# Dictionary
# Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
# A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.

# Python - Access Dictionary Items
# Get the value of the "model" key:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
x = thisdict["model"]
print(x)
# There is also a method called get() that will give you the same result:
x = thisdict.get("model")
print(x)

# Get Keys
# The keys() method will return a list of all the keys in the dictionary.
x = thisdict.keys()
print(x)

# Add a new item to the original dictionary, and see that the keys list gets updated as well:

Student = {
    "name": "Abdul rafay",
    "age": 22,
    "cgpa": 3.57
}
print(Student)
print(Student.keys())
Student["Roll No"] = 38
print(Student) #after the change

# Get Values
# The values() method will return a list of all the values in the dictionary.

print(Student.values())


# Get Items
# The items() method will return each item in a dictionary, as tuples in a list.

print(Student.items())

# Python - Change Dictionary Items

# You can change the value of a specific item by referring to its key name:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict["year"] = 2018
print(thisdict)

# Update Dictionary
# The update() method will update the dictionary with the items from the given argument.
# The argument must be a dictionary, or an iterable object with key:value pairs.
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.update({"year": 2020})
print(thisdict)

# Python - Remove Dictionary Items
# The pop() method removes the item with the specified key name:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.pop("model")
print(thisdict)


# The popitem() method removes the last inserted item (in versions before 3.7, a random item is removed instead):

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.popitem()
print(thisdict)



# The del keyword removes the item with the specified key name:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
del thisdict["model"]
print(thisdict)

# Python - Loop Dictionaries
# When looping through a dictionary, the return value are the keys of the dictionary, but there are methods to return the values as well.

for x in thisdict:
  print(x)


# You can also use the values() method to return values of a dictionary:
for x in thisdict.values():
  print(x)



# You can use the keys() method to return the keys of a dictionary:
for x in thisdict.keys():
  print(x)


# Loop through both keys and values, by using the items() method:
for x, y in thisdict.items():
  print(x, y)

# Python - Copy Dictionar


# Make a copy of a dictionary with the copy() method:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
mydict = thisdict.copy()
print(mydict)

# Make a copy of a dictionary with the dict() function:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
mydict = dict(thisdict)
print(mydict)

# Tuple
# Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
# Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
# A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
# Tuples are written with round brackets.

mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(mytuple)

# Ordered
# When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

# Unchangeable
# Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.

# Allow Duplicates
# Since tuples are indexed, they can have items with the same value:


#⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘
#⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘
# Create Tuple With One Item
thistuple = ("apple",) # we have to put a comma afterward to represent it is a tuple!!
print(type(thistuple))

#NOT a tuple
thistuple = ("apple")
print(type(thistuple))

# Access Tuple Items
# You can access tuple items by referring to the index number, inside square brackets:

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango")
print(thistuple[1])
print(thistuple[2:5])
print(thistuple[:4])
print(thistuple[2:])
print(thistuple[-4:-1])

# Python - Update Tuples

# Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its values. Tuples are unchangeable, or immutable as it also is called.
# But there is a workaround. You can convert the tuple into a list, change the list, and convert the list back into a tuple.

x = ("apple","banana","cherry")
y = list(x)
y[1] = "kiwi"
x = tuple(y)
print(x)


# Add Items
# Since tuples are immutable, they do not have a built-in append() method, but there are other ways to add items to a tuple.
# 1. Convert into a list: Just like the workaround for changing a tuple, you can convert it into a list, add your item(s), and convert it back into a tuple.
#we can add tuple to a tuple +=

thistuple = ("Apple","Banana","Cherry")
y = list(thistuple)
y.append("kiwi")
thistuple = tuple(y)
print(thistuple)

#Remove Items:
# Note: You cannot remove items in a tuple.
# Tuples are unchangeable, so you cannot remove items from it, but you can use the same workaround as we used for changing and adding tuple items:
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
y = list(thistuple)
y.remove("apple")
thistuple = tuple(y)

#del keyword can delete the tuple completely

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
del thistuple
# print(thistuple) #this will raise an error because the tuple no longer exists

# Python - Unpack Tuples
# When we create a tuple, we normally assign values to it. This is called "packing" a tuple:

# Packing a tuple:
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

# But, in Python, we are also allowed to extract the values back into variables. This is called "unpacking":

fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
(green , yellow , red) = fruits
print(green)
print(yellow)
print(red)


# Note: The number of variables must match the number of values in the tuple, if not, you must use an asterisk to collect the remaining values as a list.
#using asterisk:

fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "strawberry", "raspberry")

(green, yellow, *red) = fruits

print(green)
print(yellow)
print(red)

#Tuple methods:
# count() method
# Return the number of times the value 5 appears in the tuple:

x = thistuple.count(5)
